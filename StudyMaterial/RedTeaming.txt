Red Teaming — Study Guide (AI / LLM focus)

1) What is red teaming?
- Red teaming is adversarial testing: simulate attackers or misuse to uncover weaknesses in systems, including AI models.

2) Objectives
- Identify safety, reliability, privacy, and security vulnerabilities.
- Find prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage, and harmful outputs.

3) Common attack vectors for LLMs
- Prompt injection: input that overrides instructions or exfiltrates data.
- Jailbreaks: crafting prompts to bypass safety rules (e.g., "ignore previous instructions").
- Data exfiltration: coax model to reveal memorized sensitive information.
- Adversarial examples: inputs that cause degraded, biased, or incorrect behavior.
- Chain-of-thought leaks: forcing the model to reveal internal reasoning or hidden data.

4) Red teaming methods
- Automated fuzzing: random/structured mutation of prompts.
- Template-based attacks: systematic injection of known patterns (e.g., "follow these steps: ...").
- Human-in-the-loop: skilled testers try creative jailbreaks and social engineering prompts.
- Scenario-based: simulate phishing, misinformation, or harmful instruction requests.
- Model-to-model testing: use one model to generate adversarial prompts for another.

5) Measurements and metrics
- Frequency of harmful outputs, success rate of jailbreaks.
- Severity scoring (impact and likelihood).
- Reproducibility of exploit across prompts and users.

6) Mitigations and defenses
- Instruction hardening: prepend strong system messages and ensure they persist.
- Input sanitization: detect and neutralize suspicious patterns.
- Output filtering: use classifiers or rule-based filters before returning results.
- Rate limits and access controls to limit exploitation scale.
- Differential privacy / data minimization to reduce memorized sensitive data.
- Continuous monitoring and logging to detect anomalous queries.

7) Testing workflow
- Threat modeling: identify assets and attacker goals.
- Design tests: build cases that target specific weaknesses.
- Execute at scale: automated & manual testing.
- Triage & fix: prioritize issues and apply defenses.
- Retest and iterate.

8) Ethical and legal notes
- Red teaming may produce harmful content for testing; handle results responsibly.
- Obtain proper authorization and follow organizational policies.

9) Quick checklist for AI red teamers
- Gather model prompts, system messages, and context window usage.
- Try instruction overrides and nested instructions.
- Attempt data extraction using likely data patterns (emails, API keys).
- Test for bias and hallucination on sensitive topics.
- Validate mitigation effectiveness after fixes.
